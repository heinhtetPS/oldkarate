This repo is home to some of the source files from a game created in 2012 called "Way of the Karate", affectionally referred to as Karateman. Karateman is an over-the-top action brawler game that borrows influences from classic brawlers like CAPCOM's Final Fight, while incorporating a modern skill & runes custom loadout system similar to Blizzard's Diablo 3.

## TEAM

This was developed as a partnership between myself and [Yui Jegnan](http://yuijegnan.tumblr.com/archive), an old friend who shared my passion for game design. He was in charge of art and management while I was in charge of programming and tech. Although our project fell through due to time & financial constraints, I still want to share the awesomeness that we were able to create from scratch. 

## TECHNOLOGY

This project is written in C# and assembled in Unity3D. Since we were making a 2D game, we have also used several Unity plugins that help make the 3d environment better for 2d development. For example ExSprite is a library used to control sprite animations using spritesheets.

## MVP 

The game is currently in a working state with the following main features:

1). 4 Linear levels connected by a comic strip storyline, including a heavy tutorial level.

2). A fighting system that uses a light attack/heavy attack dichotemy and directional inputs that change these attacks. 

3). A working skill and rune customization system with ~12 base skills and light & dark variations for each, resulting in ~24 unique skills combinations. 

4). 6 different enemy types and 1 Boss, all with unique behavior and AI. 

5). An endless mode where random enemies continually spawn, that can be accessed through the dojo.

6). A unique combo system that is linked with the level's background display, which triggers different background events based on combo length.
