Hello, this contains some files from an unreleased amateur indie game I developed from 2012-2013.
The name of the game is "Way of the Karate", or affectionally referred to as Karateman. 
This was developed as a partnership between myself and Yui Jegnan, an old friend. He was in charge of art and management while I was lead programmer & project handler.  
Although our project fell through due to time & financial constraints, I still want to share the awesomeness that we were able to create from scratch.
